Is it ethical to perform an experiment on yourself that you wouldn't be permitted to perform on another? Should there be a second golden rule for the self?  As ye would that you should do  to men, do ye also to yourself likewise.
"And as ye would that men should do to you, do ye also to them likewise." -- King James Bible, Matthew 7.
