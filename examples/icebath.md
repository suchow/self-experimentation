Reducing body temperature in an ice bath to look at the effect of temperature on dark light was done by Giles S Brindley.  I couldn't find any paper on this, in a quick google search. It would very likely be coauthored with PA Merton, since they coauthored their heroic experiments. Perhaps it's reported in his 1960 book.

Found it. Here's a web page that describes both the ice-bath experiment and his later, more famous, demonstration that drugs could enable a lasting male penile erection (see below), which is widely acknowledged to have led to the modern PDE-5 inhibitors like Viagra.
