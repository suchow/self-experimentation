From the Wikipedia article on [self-experimentation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-experimentation):

> Sanctorius of Padua was probably the first documented case of self-experimentationâ€”living on a balance for 30 years in the early 17th century, weighing himself, his daily food, liquids, and combined excretions, leading him toward the discovery of metabolism[1].
